									<!-- <h3>Genomics Innovation Hub funding for technology development: Request for Proposals</h3>
									<p>
										The Cornell Genomics Innovation (GI) Hub, established by the Provostâ€™s Genome Biology Task Force, invites applications for funding to pursue genomics technology development projects, in collaboration with the GI Hub. Please submit this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfX_1I_5Xh6b5MD1Gfmkf1B6844XJ7NZopF3Y7HP1xlTr7Zdg/viewform" target="_blank" > web form </a> by <em>  5PM March 20, 2020</em> to indicate your intent to apply for GI funds (required). Final applications will be due <em> April 13, 2020</em>, with awardees notified by the end of May.
									</p> -->



									<h3>Innovator Awards</h3>
									<p>
										Up to $25,000 per award will be available for proposals that aim to develop novel genomics applications. Innovator proposals should focus on novel technology development, such as methods that are not published or publically available, or radical improvements to existing methods. Budgets may include up to $15,000 in salary support for graduate students/post-docs/staff (excluding faculty). The remainder can be applied to supplies, reagents, and services (e.g. equipment access or sequencing costs). The budget for salary support should indicate percent effort on the project over the next 12 months, with a requirement for active participation in the GI Hub.
									</p>



									<h3>Trailblazer Awards</h3>
									<p>
										$5,000-$10,000 per award will be available for proposals that aim to develop and/or utilize cutting-edge genomics applications for research. Proposals may include novel technologies as well as methods developed in the GI Hub, at Cornell, or elsewhere that are not commercialized or offered as services by core facilities or companies. Current focal technologies in the GI Hub include combinatorial barcoding strategies for single-cell or ultra-high throughput profiling assays, but proposals are not limited to these areas. Trailblazer proposals can be specific to technology development and include proof-of-principle experiments, or can focus on deploying cutting-edge methods to investigate a biological question. Budgets may include up to $10,000 for supplies, reagents, and services (e.g. equipment access or sequencing costs) but not salary support.

									</p>
									<p>
										As for any collaboration with the GI Hub, all proposals can assume access to the shared resources of the GI lab, including barcoded oligo sets and supplies for combinatorial indexing strategies, high throughput liquid handling equipment, and dedicated pre- and post-PCR lab space, at no cost to the researcher. Similarly, documentation of methods developed, improved, or implemented using GI funds or shared resources will be retained in the GI Hub and made available to the Cornell research community after publication or no later than 2 years after the award is granted. Awardees will be expected to acknowledge GI funding in presentations and publications of the proposed work.
